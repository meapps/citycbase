## Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Protocol
```typescript
interface WebSocketMessage {
  type: 'TURN' | 'SYNC' | 'HEARTBEAT' | 'ERROR';
  payload: any;
  timestamp: number;
  signature: string;
}
```

### State Sync Flow
1. Client sends turn transaction
2. Server validates and broadcasts
3. Other clients verify and apply
4. Acknowledgment sent back
5. Next turn begins

### Security Measures
1. Encrypted WebSocket connection
2. Transaction signing
3. Rate limiting per player
4. Move validation
5. Anti-tampering checks

### Scaling Strategy
1. Horizontal scaling of game servers
2. Redis for session management
3. Load balancer for distribution
4. Database sharding for persistence
5. CDN for static assets

## Development Milestones

### Month 1
- Basic WebSocket infrastructure
- Transaction system
- State synchronization

### Month 2
- Security implementation
- Player management
- Basic scaling support

### Month 3
- Enhanced features
- Testing framework
- Monitoring system

## Success Metrics
- Latency < 100ms
- 99.9% uptime
- < 1% transaction failures
- Zero security breaches
- Smooth scaling to 10k concurrent players

## Risk Mitigation
1. Fallback mechanisms for disconnections
2. Regular security audits
3. Performance monitoring
4. Load testing
5. Backup systems

## Future Considerations
1. Cross-platform support
2. Regional server deployment
3. Enhanced anti-cheat
4. Tournament support
5. Spectator features
